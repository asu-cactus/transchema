    You are generating a data-pipeline to transform multiple source tables to target table and you need to answer "what operation should be performed next?". Take this decision based on "operation history", the schema of the source, target tables, and examples in the target table.
Allowed Operations: {allowed_operation_list}.
Operation History: {operation_history}

1. Target Table Name: {target_data_name}
2. Target Schema: {target_data_schema}
3. Target Examples: {target_samples}
4. Source Information: {source_information}
{fd_hints}

{hints}


- Please answer what operation you should perform next based on "operation history", "source tables" and "target tables" information ("schema" as well as the "examples")  in one word.
- If any two source tables have different columns, DO NOT give the UNION operation.
- If there are multiple source tables and the target table having exactly same columns, give Union operation first priority .
- If there are two source tables with different schemas that share one or a few common columns, which exist in the target data, give Join operation first priority. 
- If multiple source tables share the same schema while the target table (i.e., target examples) also share the same schema, UNION must be used. However if m source tables share the same schema consisting of k non-key columns, but the target table has renamed each non-key column shared into k different columns, and thus consists of k x m non-key columns, JOIN should be applied to join all source tables on the primary key.
- Many data transformation pipelines contain a GROUP BY operator at the very end.
- Please try to make sure, using the operator history, that ALL THE COLUMNS IN THE TARGET TABLE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR.
- If you feel no more operation is needed further, please return 'NO_MORE_OPERATION'.
- You should only answer from allowed operations.
- Try not to repeat operation and it's configuration from the operation history.
- the final answer should be in $ quotes. i.e. $OPERATOR$""".format(
